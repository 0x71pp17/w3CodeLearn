## Solidity Advanced Data Structures

A focused project area for complex data organization concepts in Solidity using structs, mappings, and arrays.

### Key Concepts
- **Structs**: User-defined types that group related variables (e.g., `struct Person { string name; uint age; }`).
- **Mappings**: Key-value stores ideal for efficient lookups (e.g., `mapping(address => Person)`).
- **Arrays**: Fixed or dynamic collections for ordered data storage.
- **Combinations**: Advanced patterns like arrays of structs or mappings containing structs for sophisticated data modeling.

### Usage
Each `.sol` file includes NatSpec comments (`@title`, `@notice`, `@dev`, `@param`, `@return`) that provide standardized documentation directly within the code. 

These comments explain the purpose, behavior, and usage of contracts and functions, making the code self-documenting and easier to understand.
