# w3CodeLearn
This public repository documents my learning journey in Web3, starting with **Solidity development** for blockchain. It showcases code built while exploring smart contract concepts, serving as a personal, focused portfolio and reference point that evolves over time. 

> Note: there are no current plans to extend this collection beyond the Solidity and Web3 domain.
