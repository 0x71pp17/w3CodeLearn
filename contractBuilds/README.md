This repository contains Solidity projects of varying complexity, demonstrating core smart contract concepts and syntax.

The code is documented using NatSpec comments for clarity and ease of integration with documentation and development tools.


## Usage with Remix

Solidity code here is compatible with [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org), a web-based environment for compiling, deploying, and testing Solidity contracts. 

`Remix` supports real-time compilation, on-the-fly ABI generation, and direct deployment to various networks via injected providers like `MetaMask`.


### Steps:
1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).
2. Create new file(s) (e.g., `SimpleStorage.sol`) per filenames here and paste the contract code.
3. Navigate to the **Solidity Compiler** tab, select the correct compiler version (`^0.8.19`), and click **Compile**.
4. Go to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab.
5. Select **Remix VM** as the environment and click **Deploy**.
6. Interact with visible functions directly in the `Remix` UI.

No local setup requiredâ€”ideal for quick visual interaction with Solidity code. For multiple files, ensure correct relative paths are used for imports.
